# Bingo Game - Player Guide

Welcome to Bingo! This guide explains how to use the dashboard to track your team's progress, view tile requirements, and customize your experience.

## The Dashboard

At the top of the page, you will see the main dashboard containing vital information about your current game status:

*   **Event & Team Name**: Displays the current event title and your assigned team name.
*   **Codeword**: A secret code for the event. By default, it is hidden (`?????`). Click on it to reveal or hide the code.
*   **Points**: Your team's total score, calculated from completed tiles and bingo bonuses.
*   **Completed**: A counter showing how many tiles your team has finished out of the total (e.g., `12/49`).
*   **Mini-Map**: A small grid icon that gives you a quick visual overview of the entire board. Clicking this opens a larger view of the map.

## The Bingo Board

The main area of the screen is the Bingo Grid. Here is how to read it:

### Tile Status
*   **In Progress**: Tiles appear with the standard background color. A progress bar at the bottom of the tile shows how close you are to completion.
*   **Completed**: When a tile's requirements are met, it turns **green** (or the theme's "completed" color).
*   **Points Badge**: The bottom-right corner of each tile displays how many points it is worth.

### Tile Details
Clicking on any tile opens a detailed view containing:
*   **Title & ID**: The specific name and number of the challenge.
*   **Image**: A visual reference for the item or boss.
*   **Progress Bar**: A precise bar showing your current count versus the goal.
*   **Checklist**: As your team collects items, they will be checked off here.
*   **Description**: Additional instructions or rules for the tile.

## Game Mechanics

*   **Syncing**: The board updates automatically (default is every 30 seconds). You can see the "Last Sync" time at the bottom of the page.
*   **Manual Sync**: If you want to force an update immediately, click the **[Sync Now]** button in the footer.
*   **Bingos**: Completing a full Row, Column, or Diagonal (if applicable) often awards bonus points to your team's total score.

## Customization & Settings

Click the **Settings (Gear Icon)** in the top right corner to access player options:

### Appearance (Themes)
You can change the look of the board without affecting other players.
*   **Standard Themes**: Choose from a wide variety of built-in themes like *OSRS*, *Dark Mode*, *Dracula*, *Cyberpunk*, and more.

### Data Settings
*   **Sync Interval**: Adjust how frequently the board checks for new data (e.g., 15 seconds, 1 minute, 5 minutes).

## Troubleshooting

*   **"No Team Configured"**: If you see this message, ensure you are using the correct link provided by your event organizer (usually ending in `?team=Team1`).
*   **Board not updating**: Check your internet connection and try clicking **[Sync Now]** at the bottom of the page.
